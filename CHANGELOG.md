## [0.2.0]

Hello! This release features a basic implementation of the Toggl Track summary view for the sidebar.
Currently, this view can show you an overview of your day (total time + breakdown per project),
but in the future I will add more functionality to it (e.g. choose between day or week summary). 
Additonally, you can see your current time entry here as well as a button to start or stop time entries.

If you have any suggestions on how this sidebar panel can be improved for your workflow, please post in the Discussions tab on GitHub or tag me on the Obsidian Discord server! 

### ✨ Features

- Add summary of current time entry in side panel
- Add functionality to start or stop timers from the side panel (button triggers the respective commands)

### ⚙️ Internal
