## [0.4.0]

This is the biggest update so far! This update enables you to visualize your Toggl time entry data right inside your Obsidian notes.

To learn how, check out the [getting started](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-toggl-integration/wiki/Creating-Toggl-reports-inside-notes) page!

## [0.3.0]

### ‚ú® Features

- Sidebar view now shows tags on active time entry.
- You can now add tags to a new time entry when entering the description.

## [0.2.5]

### HOTFIX

- Reduced the active timer polling rate to once every 6 seconds by request by from the Toggl Track API team.

## [0.2.4]

### HOTFIX

Toggl started responding with error status 418 on all requests with the default user-agent of the npm got package, so I set a custom user agent to identify calls made by this plugin.

Hopefully this won't happen again!

## [0.2.0]

Hello! This release features a basic implementation of the Toggl Track summary view for the sidebar.
Currently, this view can show you an overview of your day (total time + breakdown per project),
but in the future I will add more functionality to it (e.g. choose between day or week summary). 
Additonally, you can see your current time entry here as well as a button to start or stop time entries.

If you have any suggestions on how this sidebar panel can be improved for your workflow, please post in the Discussions tab on GitHub or tag me on the Obsidian Discord server! 

### ‚ú® Features

- Add summary of current time entry in side panel
- Add functionality to start or stop timers from the side panel (button triggers the respective commands)
- Add summary view of current day in side panel

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internal

- Upgraded [toggl-client](https://github.com/saintedlama/toggl-client) dependency to commit `4a40a9d` of master branch to add the Toggl Reports API.
